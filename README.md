# Coding-Quiz

## Coding Quiz
This project utilized HTML, CSS, and Javascript to generate a quiz to test the user's programming knowledge, specifically those in the Georgia Tech bootcamp.<br>
<br>
The header displays a link to go to the leaderboard, the score counter, and the timer.<br>
<br>
Once a user clicks the "Start Quiz" button, the timer begins counting down from 75 as they are presented with a series of multiple-choice questions.<br>
<br>
If a correct answer is selected, they are awarded 1 point (tracked at the top of the screen), "Correct!" is logged at the bottom of the screen, and the next question is presented.<br>
<br>
If they make an incorrect selection, 15 seconds are subtracted from the timer, "Wrong!" is logged at the bottom of the screen, and the next question is presented.<br>
<br>
When the timer reaches 0, their final score is presented, and they are given the option to enter their initials. After submitting their initials, they are taken to a leaderboard page.<br>
<br>
The leaderboard page should track high scores, as well as present two button options: to return to the home screen, or to clear the leaderboard.<br>
